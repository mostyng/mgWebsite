		      	<p>
		      	    I was approached by two students from Brown to help them build FlairTime, a social app centered around creating events and having users collaboratively document events. This included a total rebranding of the app, changing its name to Flare, and a close collaboration with the developer on the user interface/experience of the application.

	              The rebranding process involved changing the name of the app from Flairtime to Flare; a choice made to introduce more energy into the brand. I thought that the act of creating and sharing an event with friends could be associated with the image of launching a flare.

	          <p class="rightText">
	              The logo was changed from a simple blue flame to a mark that contains both the "F" in Flare as well as a flare in the counterform.

	          <p class="rightText">
	              The main issues with the original Event Tile user interface were problems with the visual hierarchy of user's content, event information, and a general lack of consideration for driving user interaction.

		      	<p class="rightText">
		      		The new Event Tiles optimize a user's viewing experience by being able to remove unecessary modules when certain data is not present. An example of this is if less than 5 people are joined, then the Guest Bar does not appear. Early on in an event, this allows the action bar and gallery to be more visible to entice both viewing and interaction.

		      	<p class="rightText">
		      		These modules have been designed to increase interaction by setting larger action icons within the gallery pane alongside user content. What this does, especially early on during an event, is to entice users to fill the gallery with their content.

They would then be able to post content on the Event Page which features a gallery of guests' content as well as additional information about the event. The Gallery View allows users to quickly scroll through all the highlights of an event.
