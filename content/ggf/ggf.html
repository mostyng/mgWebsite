		      	<p>
		      		Starting December 2019, I was involved in drafting and executing a new iteration of Watson Assistant. The project was called Actions. This product concept had the goal of optimizing Assistant for non-technical users and allow them to create chatbots 60% faster than with the current version (Watson Assistant Dialog).
		      	</p>
		      	<p>
		      		I conducted iterative user tests and taking that research to inform multiple UX design sprints. From there we wireframed, prototyped, and are continuing to develop the product by testing it against current Dialog users.
