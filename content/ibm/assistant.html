      	<h1>Watson Assistant: Actions</h1>
      	<p>
      		Starting December 2019, I was involved in drafting and executing a new iteration of Watson Assistant. The project was called Actions. This product concept had the goal of optimizing Assistant for non-technical users and allow them to create chatbots 60% faster than with the current version (Watson Assistant Dialog).
      	</p>
      	<p>
      		We conducted iterative user tests and took that research to inform multiple UX design sprints. Using that information we wireframed, prototyped, and are continuing to develop the product by testing it against current Dialog users. Watson Assistant: Actions is currently being tested in an open-beta. Because of that, much of the process work is currently under NDA.
      	</p>
      	<p>
      		However, feel free to enjoy a selection of motion graphics I made for various Watson Assistant onboarding and marketing materials used to promote the new Actions skill.
