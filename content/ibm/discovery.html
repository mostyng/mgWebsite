		      		Beginning in March 2019, I had the privilege to join the Watson Discovery design team following my graduation from IBM’s interdisciplinary Patterns bootcamp. Watson Discovery is an AI-powered application that uses text analytics and natural language processing to allow users to create robust enterprise search engines. Companies utilize Watson Discovery to find answers to complex domain-specific questions.
		      	</p>
		      	<p>
		      		The project I was tasked with involved entirely revamping the current Watson Discovery experience. The process of understanding how to improve the product began with a workshop that had occurred earlier in the year prior to my arrival on the team.

		      	</p>
		      	<p>
		      		What came out of the workshop were some “Hills” or experiential goals we wanted to work towards. These included
		      	</p>
		      	<p>
		      		The first deliverable we worked on was a “Concept car” document. This was the proof-of-concept that outlined the experiential goals we wanted to create for our users in order to empower them in their role.

		      	</p>
		      	<p>
		      		I was given ownership of Discovery’s Improvement panel. This is a  feature which allows users to diagnose why they weren’t returning the best search results and promptly train Discovery’s AI to get certain results from a set search query.
