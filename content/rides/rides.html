		      	    RIDES is an autonomous public transportation system prototyped by a team of 24 undergraduate design students during the 5-week RISD Industrial Design Wintersession course, Autonomous Vehicle Futures, instructed by MID candidate Jeremy Bass.
		      	</p>
		      	<p>
		      	    My role in this project involved leading a team of four design students in the creation of user access points. This included generating interfaces across multiple platforms: a smartphone app, ticketing kiosk, and finally an integrated SMS/Messenger chatbot.

	                One of my other responsibilities included creating the brand identity for the system. This involved devising the naming, logo, colors, typography and various interface assets.

	                RIDES is an acronym that stands for Rhode Island Driverless Electrical System. Brand positioning for RIDES followed our desire to appeal to local riders in the Providence area.

	            <p>
	                In prototyping the layout of the application, we decided to begin with a familiar map UI as a landing screen. This reflected our desire to use the core application as an opportunity to emphasize visual components and isotypes as opposed to a text-heavy approach in order to allow users of various language backgrounds and levels of reading comprehension to be better accommodated into the RIDES ecosystem.

	                By creating both a graphical interface in tandem with a messaging interface, users can choose to use either one exclusively without losing key functionality. However, by using them together the user will experience both robust utility and personability in wayfinding.

	        	  Public transportation is a service for all; therefore access points must be designed for use by people of varying physical abilities and economic backgrounds.

	        	  <p class="rightText">
	        	  The RIDES' mascot is Rhody, a virtual wayfinding assistant modeled after the state bird, the Rhode Island Red Rooster. Besides being the brand's personality, Rhody is central in RIDES' mission to creating an equitable user experience.  
	        	  </p><br>
	        	  <p class="rightText">
	        	  What came out of this driving principle of accessibility was not only the core application, but a conversational AI available across multiple platforms and user touchpoints.
