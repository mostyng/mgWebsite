		      	    RIDES is an autonomous public transportation system prototyped by a team of 24 undergraduate design students during the 5-week RISD Industrial Design Wintersession course, Autonomous Vehicle Futures, instructed by MID candidate Jeremy Bass.

		      	<p>
		      	    My role in this project involved leading a team of four design students in the creation of user access points. This included generating interfaces across multiple platforms: a smartphone app, ticketing kiosk, and finally an integrated SMS/Messenger chatbot.

	                Since I was the only graphic designer in the team, I also had the responsibility of creating the brand identity for the system. This involved devising the naming, logo, colors, typography and various interface assets.

	            <p>
	            	The wayfinding group began by conducting several rounds of user research. We began with several field studies of Providence's current public transit system, <a href="https://www.ripta.com/" target="blank">RIPTA.</a> While using the bus, we each talked to riders, drivers, and pedestrians.</p><br>
	            <p> 
	            	The most common issues we heard from daily RIPTA users was that the buses often ran off-schedule, often showing up much later than usual. What we heard from pedestrians who did not use RIPTA's buses was that they felt that either scheduling was not easy enough to find, or that bus stops weren't located in convenient locations for them.
	            </p><br>
	            <p>
	            	With this information in hand we decided that the driving principle of our user experience should be accessibility. In order to make a truly useful, dependable autonomous transit system, we needed to make it effortless to summon scheduling, stop locations, and access transit help.

	            <p>
	                In wireframing the layout of the application, we decided to begin with a familiar map UI as a landing screen. This reflected our desire to use the core application as an opportunity to emphasize visual components and isotypes as opposed to a text-heavy approach in order to allow users of various language backgrounds and levels of reading comprehension to be better accommodated into the RIDES ecosystem.

	            <p>
	                By creating both a graphical interface in tandem with a messaging interface, users can choose to use either one exclusively without losing key functionality. However, by using them together the user will experience both robust utility and personability in wayfinding.

The chat functionality allows users that are visually impaired or more interested in a hands-free experience to get to a desired location.
