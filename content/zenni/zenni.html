  	  	<h1>Zenni Rebrand</h1>
  	  	<p>
  	  		During my summer internship at Salt Branding, I was lucky enough to be able to contribute to the rebranding of Zenni Optical, a pivotal direct-to-consumer brand that creates a curated shopping experience  delivering exponential choice at dramatically lower price tags. I was involved in extrapolating the new brand identity into a design system for physical packaging and a virtual retail space.

  	  	<h2>The Eyewear Wardrobe</h2>
  	  	<p>
  	  	    Price is a simple calculation. In the case of Zenni, however, price creates a fundamentally new way to think about eyewear. When people can afford multiple pairs of glasses, suddenly, self-expression becomes a powerful and inviting story. 
  	  	</p>
  	  	<p>
  	  	    We were able to crystallize this idea with a new statement for the brand: Eyewear For Every You. By elevating individuality and style, we transformed price into an empowering message of self-expression.

  	  	<p>
  	  		The design of the Zenni wordmark and logo reflected this switch to a richer brand experience. The look is fashion-driven and reinforces a strong sense of quality and craft – an important asset for eyewear at such a surprisingly low price. All elements of the system – from textural patterns and color palettes to typography and photography – help express the new positioning of personal style.
  	  	</p>
  	  	<p>
  	  		While the visual language brought a new level of style and design sense, it’s important to note Zenni is a populist brand. In spirit and mission -- it’s Target, not Lord & Taylor. We developed a verbal identity and voice that was more lighthearted, inclusive and invitational. The Zenni message encouraged people to re-imagine eyewear from a fresh point of view. Out with expensive and elitist, in with affordable, engaging and fun.

	   	  	<h2>The Zenni Web Experience</h2>
	   	  	<p>
	   	  		The entire brand came to life on the Zenni e-commerce website. We explored all ideas for how people would browse, try on frames virtually, fill their shopping carts and make personal profiles. Buying prescription glasses online is a new idea, so we created a learning center to kickstart their education. Ultimately, all UX and UI work centered on building a stronger relationship with new customers and long-time fans.
	   	  	</p>
	   	  	<p>
	   	  		We also examined how we could rev up the retail experience. We helped develop a year round program of collections, sub-brands and seasonal promotion ideas that would keep the Zenni story fresh and relevant. An extensive set of seasonal color palettes brought a distinctive and energetic look to each month of the calendar.

	   	  	<h2>Takeaways</h2>
	   	  	<p>
	   	  		In taking a 360-degree view of the Zenni brand, we were able to unify all the touch points into one cohesive story. A company built on a price tag now has a compelling brand story that celebrates individual style and creative expression.
